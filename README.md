# Advent of Code 2024

Run solutions using `cargo run -- DAY` where DAY is the day number (1-25), e.g., `cargo run -- 1` for day 1. Input files should be placed in `input/dayXX.txt` (where XX is the two-digit day number). To add new days, create `src/solutions/sXX.rs` (where XX is the two-digit day number), implement a `solve` function that takes a string input and returns an i64, then add the module declaration `pub mod sXX;` to `src/main.rs` and add the day number to the match statements in `run_day()`.

## I am currently 23rd in the world! this repo will take longer to update as I solve the challenges in python first.
